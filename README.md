You will need `npm` to build the project.

To install the project dependencies, run
```sh
npm install
```

To build the project and start an HTTP server, run
```sh
npm run dev
```

The application will then be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). As long as you leave the `npm run dev` process running, the project will be rebuilt automatically whenever a file is changed.
